# Online Monitoring of Unauthorized Construction 

## Overview
This cutting-edge project harnesses the power of **Mask R-CNN** for precise detection and segmentation of unauthorized construction sites using drone imagery. By integrating **Geospatial Data Processing (GDP)** and **Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors**, it ensures highly accurate area assessments and volumetric analysis, enhancing regulatory compliance and real-time monitoring.

## How It Works

### **1. Detection & Segmentation via Mask R-CNN**
The system utilizes a **Mask R-CNN** model trained on a custom dataset of drone-captured images to detect and segment unauthorized structures.

#### **Steps for Area Detection:**
- Extract segmented regions as binary masks.
- Georeference these masks to align them with real-world spatial coordinates.
- Convert pixel-based areas into **real-world measurements (square meters)** using **Geospatial Data Processing (GDP)** tools.

### **2. Validation with Time-of-Flight (ToF) Sensors**
ToF sensors are employed to measure depth and volumetric details, ensuring precise assessment of unauthorized structures.

#### **Steps for Validation:**
- **Depth Analysis:** Accurately measures structure height.
- **Volumetric Estimation:** Ensures accurate 3D mapping for compliance verification.
